## Ranger Class Features

As a Ranger, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Ranger levels. These features are listed in the Ranger Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells.

**_Spell Slots._** The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

#### Level 1: Favored Enemy

You always have the [Hunter’s Mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

#### Level 2: Deft Explorer

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.

**_Expertise._** Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain [Expertise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) in that skill.

**_Languages._** You know two languages of your choice.

#### Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice. Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

##### Druidic Warrior

#### Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower.

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.

**_Temporary Hit Points._** As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can give yourself a number of [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**_Decrease Exhaustion._** Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level, if any, decreases by 1.
