<!-- ### -->
#### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

**_Damage Resistance._** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**_Rage Damage._** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**_Strength Advantage._** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**_No Concentration or Spells._** You can’t maintain Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.

**_Duration._** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.

#### Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

#### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

#### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: [Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

#### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

#### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

#### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**_Forceful Blow._** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

**_Hamstring Blow._** The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

#### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

#### Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

**_Staggering Blow._** The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of your next turn.

**_Sundering Blow._** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

#### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition (not just the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition) or don Heavy armor.

#### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

#### Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

#### Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, and their maximum is now 25.

### Subclasses

## Path of the Berserker

_Channel Rage into Violent Fury_

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

#### Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

#### Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) and [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

#### Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

#### Level 14: Intimidating Presence

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) creature’s turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

## Path of the Wild Heart

## Path of the World Tree

## Path of the Zealot

<!-- ### -->

## Ancestral Guardian (XGE)

## Storm Herald (XGE)

## Battlerager (Custom)

Original:
### Restriction: Dwarves Only

Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.

### Battlerager Armor

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use [spiked armor](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/armor) as a weapon.

While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.

### Reckless Abandon

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.

### Battlerager Charge

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.

### Spiked Retribution

Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor.

Previous Version:

- **Battlerager Armor.** When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor, and all forms of spiked armor, and the ability to use it as a weapon. You suffer no penalties for sleeping in armor, and you can enter a Rage while wearing heavy armor. In addition, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor, you can still benefit from raging while wearing heavy armor, and you do not count the weight of any worn armor when determining your carrying capacity.
- **Spiked Retribution.** At 3rd level, while you are wearing spiked armor and raging, creatures that hit you with a melee attack while within 5 feet suffer piercing damage equal to your rage damage bonus. Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier if your grapple check succeeds.
- **Reckless Abandon.** At 6th level, whenever you use the Reckless Attack feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus your Constitution modifier. They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends. You may use this feature once per rage.
- **Battlerager Charge.** Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.
- **Barbed Blitz.** Starting at 14th level, whenever you are raging and move in a straight line on your turn, you may make one extra attack against each enemy that is within 5ft of the path you take, this attack causes 1d10 piercing damage plus your rage bonus if it hits. Once you use this feature you can not use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Spiked Armor

When wearing Spiked Armor a proficient creature can use it to make melee weapon attacks dealing 1d6 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. All spiked armors give disadvantage on Stealth checks. You can purchase or construct spiked variants of leather armor, hide armor, breastplate, half-plate, and plate. As well as shields. These versions of the items cost and weigh an additional 25% but have the same statistics and properties otherwise.
