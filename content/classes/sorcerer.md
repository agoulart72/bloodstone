Sorcerers são magos que possuem a força da magia em seu sangue. Porém seu aprendizado de magia não é feito da forma tradicional, através de fórmulas e livros. Sorcerers possuem energia mágica em seu sangue, eles são descendentes de linhagens antigas que possuíam poderes mágicos. Sorcerers aprendem a libertar a magia inata a eles através de movimentos repetitivos e mantras. Alguns aprendem estes movimentos de outros sorcerers, outros aprendem sozinhos através de experimentação e meditação.

Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells.
Cantrips.You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you are able to cast. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell of a level that you are able to cast.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.
Spell Points. The Sorcerer table shows the number of Sorcery Points that you have to cast the Sorcerer spells you know of 1st-level and higher. To cast a Sorcerer spell, you must expend the amount of Sorcery Points indicated in the table below. You regain all expended Sorcery Points each time you finish a long rest.

Note: When you cast a spell using spell points, the behaviour is exactly the same as another spellcasters using spell slots. That means that you are limited to cast only one spell per turn using spell points, and is affected in the same way by any other rules that references spell slots. 
Spell Limit.Your Sorcerer level limits the potency of spells that you can produce, as shown in the Spell Limit column of the Sorcerer Table. When a feature allows you to expend Spell Points, you can never expend more Spell Points on that feature than it costs to cast a spell equal to your Spell Limit level.

Level 1: Innate Sorcery
	An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you can cast your spells without spending your spell points.
	To cast a spell during this moment without spending spell points you must roll a Casting Check, which uses the following formula :
	d20 + Charisma Modifier + Proficiency Bonus

The DC of this check is based on the level of the spell according to the following table : 

Spell Level
Casting DC
1st
10
2nd
12
3rd
15
4th
17
5th
20

Success. If the roll succeeds, the spell is cast as normal, and you don’t have to spend any spell points.
Failure. If the check fails you may spend spell points as normal for the spell to succeed, otherwise the spell fizzles and is wasted with no effect.
Backlash. If at any time the roll is equal to or lower than the level of the spell being cast, the Sorcerer reduces the spell limit of the spells he can cast while using Innate Sorcery by one. The sorcerer can still cast these spells using spell points. The spell limit returns to normal at the end of a short or long rest.
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
You gain extra uses of this ability at levels 6th, 11th and 17th.

Level 2: Font of Magic
When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain a number of expended Spell Points equal to your Sorcerer level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest

Level 2: Metamagic
Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “Metamagic Options” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Spell Points that it costs.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.
Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass
You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration
You are no longer restricted in the number of uses of your Font of Magic feature. You can use this feature every time you finish a short or long rest.
Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate
If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can strain yourself to use it again. You can activate it as normal using a Bonus Action, when the feature ends you gain one level of Exhaustion.
In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.

Level 11: Innate Arcanum
You uncover a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Sorcerer spell as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending spell points, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.
As shown in the Sorcerer Features table, you gain another Sorcerer spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Sorcerer levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Innate Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Sorcerer spell of the same level.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis
While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Spell Points on it.
