Bardos são conhecidos como historiadores, heraldas, mensageiros e conselheiros, e são bem vindos em todos os lugares. Os primeiros bardos de Cerília foram elfos enviados às terras dos humanos para estudar e ensinar seus vizinhos humanos. Cada um destes elfos deu origem a um colégio de bardos; hoje, os estudantes continuam o trabalho de seus mentores. Aqueles treinados nas tradições dos bardos (independente da raça) possuem uma limitada técnica de magia através da música.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**_Using Bardic Inspiration._** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

**_Number of Uses._** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**_At Higher Levels._** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.

**_Spell Slots._** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and lack [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

#### Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

#### Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

#### Level 10: Magical Secrets

You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you. In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

#### Level 20: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the [Power Word Heal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618880-power-word-heal) and [Power Word Kill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618886-power-word-kill) spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

Weave Beguiling Fey Magic

The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories, and the mightiest among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten innocence, evoke unconscious memories of long-held fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.

Level 3: Beguiling Magic
You always have the Charm Person and Mirror Image spells prepared.

In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a spell slot, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed or Frightened condition (your choice) for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).

Level 3: Mantle of Inspiration
You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

Level 6: Mantle of Majesty
You always have the Command spell prepared.

As a Bonus Action, you cast Command without expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or until your Concentration ends. During this time, you can cast Command as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot.

Any creature Charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell slot (no action required).

Level 14: Unbreakable Majesty
As a Bonus Action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. For the duration, whenever any creature hits you with an attack roll for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the attack misses instead, as the creature recoils from your majesty.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

Level 3: Cutting Words
You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

Level 6: Magical Discoveries
You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or any combination thereof. A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Bard Features table.

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

Level 14: Peerless Skill
When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.

Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes

Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events doesn’t pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

Level 3: Combat Inspiration
You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.

Defense. When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

Offense. Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack’s damage against the target.

Level 3: Martial Training
You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.

In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.

Level 6: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

Level 14: Battle Magic
After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.

Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and the scimitar.

If you’re proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

Fighting Style
At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Dueling. When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
Two-Weapon Fighting. When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

Blade Flourish
At 3rd level, you learn to conduct impressive displays of martial prowess and speed.

Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.

Defensive Flourish. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.

Slashing Flourish. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Mobile Flourish. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.

Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Master's Flourish
Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.

Psychic Blades
When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.

The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.

Words of Terror* (Replace) - You learn the "Cause Fear" spell if you don't know it, it does not count against the number of your known spells. You can cast this spell without spending a spell slot up to a number of times equal to your Prof. Bonus. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest. Also when you cast it, you may expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to improve your spell. Roll your Bardic Inspiration dice and adds its result to your spell DC for this casting of the spell.

Mind Probe (Variant 6th) - At 6th level, your ability to gather information and lore gains a supernatural edge. You can cast detect thoughts without spending a spell slot up to a number of times equal to your Prof. Bonus. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest.

At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.

You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.

While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.

Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.

Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.

Shadows of the Dead (Variant 6th) - When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. When you do so, it magically manifest in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This shadow is a magical, translucent, gray image of the dead creature that lasts for an hour, or until it is destroyed, you dismiss it as a bonus action, you manifest another shadow, or until you're incapacitated or finish a short or long rest. The shadow is ethereal and immune to all conditions. It is the same size as the deceased, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the shadow to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If the shadow is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. If attacked by any means that could inflict damage upon an ethereal creature, it is destroyed. The shadow gives you the following abilities:

During your turn you can teleport, magically swapping places with the shadow at a cost of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you, as long as you can see the shadow.
You can cast spells as though you were in the shadow's space, but you must use your own senses.

Shadow Lore
At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.

As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.

If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret.

While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it. While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.

When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

You can use the vicious mockery cantrip as a bonus action, and may add your charisma modifier to the damage you deal with your vicious mockery cantrip.
Crawling Dodge - Starting at 6th level, whenever you are 5ft near a friendly creature, when an enemy tries to attacks you, you can use your reaction to move around and hide behind your ally, causing the enemy to have disadvantage to hit you.

Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one.
