Druidas são sacerdotes de Gaia. Existem druidas em várias regiões de Cerilia, mas é nas terras dos Rjurik onde os círculos são mais poderosos. Os druidas são organizados em círculos, cada círculo compreendendo uma região. Alguns círculos são mais fortes e possuem muitos druidas, como o círculo da terra na região dos Rjurik. Outros círculos são pequenos, como os shamans espiritualistas das terras dos Vos.

Em nível 1, o druida é considerado apenas um aprendiz. Quando ele atinge o nível 3 ele deve procurar um dos círculos (geralmente onde ele foi iniciado), onde ele será submetido a alguns testes. Ao passar nestes testes, o druida passa a fazer parte do círculo. Os testes variam para cada círculo.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

**_Spell Slots._** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

#### Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you [shape-shift](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**_Number of Uses._** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.

**_Known Forms._** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024)_ or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.

Beast Shapes

| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:---------:|
|      2      |      4      |  1/4   |    No     |
|      4      |      6      |  1/2   |    No     |
|      8      |      8      |   1    |    Yes    |

**_Rules While Shape-Shifted._** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

**_Temporary Hit Points._** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Druid level.

**_Game Statistics._** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

**_No Spellcasting._** You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.

**_Objects._** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.

#### Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.

#### Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.

**_Primal Strike._** The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

#### Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

#### Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

**_Evergreen Wild Shape._** Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

**_Nature Magician._** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

**_Longevity._** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

#### Level 3 - Speech of the Woods
You gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.
You learn Sylvan, if you already know Sylvan, you learn another language of your choice. You may cast Speak With Animals at will.

#### Level 3 - Spirit Totem
You can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you.
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you.
The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectrl appearance of the creature it represents.
As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.
The spirit persists for 1 minute or unitl you're incapacitated or use this feature again.
The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.
- *Bear Spirit* - The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. As a reaction when a creature in your aura ends its turn, you may grant them temporary hit points equal to 5+ your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.
- *Hawk Spirit* -  The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. As a reaction when a creature in your aura makes an attack, you may grant them advantage on that attack and any attacks they make until the start of your next turn. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.
- *Unicorn Spirit* - The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. As a reaction when a creature in your aura recovers hit points, you may increase the number of hit points regained by an amount equal to 5+ your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura.

#### Level 6 - Mighty Summoner

At 6th level, beasts and fey that you summon are more resilient than normal. 
When you use a spell to summon a beast of fey they gain the following benefits:

- The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 5 extra hit points per level of the spell that summoned it.

- The creature may deal its normal damage type with its attacks, or force damage. You make this choice each time the creature hits with an attack.

#### Level 10 - Guardian Spirit

Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic.  At the end of your turn, choose a beast of fey that you summoned or created with a spell in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to your druid level.

#### Level 14 - Faithful Summons

Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of 
*Summon Beast* as if it were cast with a 9th-level spell slot.
The summoned beast appears within 20 feet of you. If it receives no command from you, it protects you from harm and attacks your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
