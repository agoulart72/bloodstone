The dwarves are an ancient and proud race of craftsmen and engineers, known for their skill in metallurgy and stonework. Unlike traditional dwarves, they do not live underground, but instead roam the countryside in massive landships—gigantic wheeled vehicles that serve as both homes and mobile workshops. These landships are powered by ancient engines, once shared by all clans but now modified by each clan to fit their unique needs and preferences.

**Clans**:

- **Ironclaw Clan**: The warrior clan, crafters of powerful magic infused weapons and enchanted armor. They have
the best equipped and trained mercenary units of all.
    
- **Stonehammer Clan**: Traditionalists, the Stonehammers focus on preserving ancient dwarven techniques of stone and metalwork, maintaining a connection to their ancestors’ craftsmanship.
    
- **Thunderforge Clan**: Known for their engineering prowess, the Thunderforge prioritize innovation and the development of powerful war machines.
    
- **Grimsteel Clan**: Some say that the members of the Grimsteel were cursed by a god with madness. This clans raids on cities and other clans, stealing or destroying everything in their path.

- **Runecarver Clan**: Focus on developing body, mind and spirit, the members of this clan values wisdom and knowledge. They are also tamers of fantastic beasts.
    

With a deep connection to their ancient technology and a resistance to magic, dwarves are both respected and feared. Their society is built around honor, craftsmanship, and survival, but as time goes on, their once-unified race is starting to develop differing ideals and goals, with each clan embracing a distinct vision of the future.
