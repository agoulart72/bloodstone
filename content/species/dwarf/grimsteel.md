History and Origin
The Grimsteel Clan emerged from the ashes of the old citadels, born from dwarves who rejected the old ways of tradition and craftsmanship. Instead, they embraced the chaotic nature of survival, resorting to raiding, banditry, and a nomadic lifestyle. They are the descendants of those who couldnâ€™t adapt to the structured, traditionalist ways of the other clans and instead sought to live by their wits and strength, carving their own path in a harsh world.

Government and Politics
The Grimsteel Clan has no formal government. Instead, it is a loose collection of bandit lords, mercenaries, and outlaws, with power determined by strength and cunning. The clan is led by the Warlord, the most ruthless and influential member, but leadership can change rapidly in times of conflict. The Grimsteel dwarves thrive in chaos and prefer to operate without rigid rules, allowing individual members to take whatever they can from others, as long as they can defend their claim.

Society and Culture
Grimsteel society is one of survival and opportunism. They have little respect for authority or tradition, focusing instead on the here and now. The Grimsteel dwarves are pragmatic, often turning to violence and theft to get what they need. Their culture is harsh and unforgiving, but they place great value on personal strength and independence. Their festivals are often centered around displays of power, such as brutal combat tournaments or daring heists.

Military Tradition
The Grimsteel Clan is built for guerrilla warfare and hit-and-run tactics. Their military tradition revolves around speed, surprise, and overwhelming force. They prefer to strike quickly and retreat before the enemy can retaliate. The Grimsteel dwarves are also skilled in sabotage, using traps, explosives, and unconventional weapons to disrupt their foes. They are expert raiders, often striking at night or when the enemy is least prepared.

Economy and Technology
The Grimsteel Clan thrives through plunder, mercenary work, and selling stolen goods. They are not known
