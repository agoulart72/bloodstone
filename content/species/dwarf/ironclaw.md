### History and Origin
The Ironclaw Clan traces its origins to a group of warriors who refused to fall in the face of the orog invasion. They retreated into the mountains, keeping their fighting spirit alive by waging guerilla warfare against the orogs and other threats. Their citadels fell, but they adapted, becoming wandering warriors, never staying in one place for too long. The Ironclaw have a deep sense of pride, rooted in their martial traditions, and they believe their true destiny is to reclaim their ancestral lands, even if it means waging endless war.

### Government and Politics
The Ironclaw Clan operates under a military hierarchy, with power given to the most successful warriors and tacticians. Leadership is earned in battle, and the clan’s council is composed of veterans who have proven themselves in the heat of war. The clan respects strength, both physical and tactical, and each member has a voice in clan decisions if they have earned the right through battle prowess.

### Society and Culture
Ironclaw dwarves value honor, strength, and self-reliance. They are a close-knit clan, with bonds forged in battle. Their culture revolves around combat training, discipline, and remembrance of their fallen comrades. Festivals are often held to celebrate martial achievements, and storytelling is an important part of passing down the clan’s legacy. They have little patience for weakness, and their sense of identity is closely tied to their warrior spirit.

### Military Tradition
The Ironclaw Clan is built around warfare. Combat training begins at an early age, with the young being taught how to wield a variety of weapons and armor. Their military tactics focus on aggressive, hit-and-run skirmishes, as well as siege warfare when reclaiming lost citadels. While many Ironclaw warriors are skilled in single combat, the clan is also known for its strategic use of war machines and siege engines, often bringing their mobile warships into battle.

### Economy and Technology
The Ironclaw Clan is largely focused on the construction and maintenance of war machines and weapons. Their economy is built around the production of arms, armor, and mobile fortresses. They trade their martial prowess and advanced siege engines with other clans and civilizations, but they prioritize self-sufficiency, always working to improve their technology for the next battle. While they are not a technologically advanced society, their craftsmanship in creating weapons and war machines is unparalleled.
