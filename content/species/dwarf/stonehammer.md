### History and Origin
The Stonehammer Clan has deep roots in the mountain citadels. They are the descendants of the stoneworkers and artisans who once shaped the grandest fortresses and cities. After the orog invasion destroyed much of their civilization, the Stonehammer dwarves became the keepers of the old ways, holding on to their traditions of stonecraft, architecture, and ancestor worship. They focus on rebuilding what was lost, even if it means retreating into the mountains or working slowly over generations.

### Government and Politics
The Stonehammer Clan is ruled by a council of elder craftsmen and leaders, known as the Stone Council. This body is made up of the clan’s most revered builders, masons, and historians, who act as both lawmakers and advisors. Political decisions are made with a focus on preservation and restoration, with leaders selected based on their contributions to the clan’s cultural and material heritage. The Stonehammer dwarves prize wisdom and patience above all else in their leadership.

### Society and Culture
Stonehammer society revolves around craftsmanship, family, and tradition. Every dwarf is taught the arts of stonework and metalworking, and their education is deeply rooted in understanding the past. Their homes are filled with relics of the old citadels, and festivals often celebrate the completion of monumental structures or the restoration of ancient works. Stonehammer dwarves believe that their ancestors’ spirits linger in the stones they carve and build, and their culture is one of reverence for the earth and the work it demands.

### Military Tradition
While the Stonehammer Clan values combat skill, their military traditions are focused more on defense than offense. They are renowned for their mastery of fortifications and siege defense, creating intricate, impregnable strongholds in the mountains and plains. Their warriors are trained as defenders and guardians, skilled in the use of hammers, shields, and siege weapons. The Stonehammer military places great emphasis on holding the line and using terrain to their advantage, rather than engaging in offensive operations.

### Economy and Technology
The Stonehammer Clan thrives on mining, quarrying, and crafting. They have an unmatched talent for working stone, and they produce some of the finest masonry, architecture, and crafted goods in the world. Their economy is based on the trade of these materials, as well as their skills as builders and engineers. Though they are slower to adapt to new technologies, their methods are tried and true, and their structures last for generations. They are also skilled in creating defensive mechanisms and traps for their strongholds.
