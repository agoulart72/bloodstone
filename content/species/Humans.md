Anuire

Following the death of the last emperor and the collapse of the unified empire, **Anuire** fragmented into numerous independent regions. The **Gorgon**, a mythical enemy, played a significant role in the empire’s fall, and with no central authority, the once-mighty empire was plagued by internal conflicts. As various factions vied for control, a feudal system solidified, and many noble houses rose to power.

Anuire is now divided into several key regions, each ruled by its own aristocratic families, who engage in complex power struggles. Some regions remain loyal to the old imperial ideals, while others seek independence or dominance.

Here are some potential noble houses and factions within **Anuire**:
### Noble Houses:

1. **House Denaroth**: Once the imperial family, they still hold great sway in the central provinces. They seek to restore the empire's glory and reunite the fragmented realm under their rule.
    
2. **House Cirelith**: A house known for their military prowess and strategic alliances. They are keen to maintain their independent holdings, with a focus on maintaining control over key trade routes.
    
3. **House Alvani**: A wealthy and influential family, the Alvani are known for their mercantile power and connections with other factions. They often act as power brokers, playing both sides of political disputes.
    
4. **House Veldris**: A house that rose to prominence by exploiting the chaos following the fall of the empire. They control vast lands in the north and are notorious for their ruthless tactics and political maneuvering.
    
### Factions:

1. **The Imperial Loyalists**: A faction of noble families and commoners who still believe in the legitimacy of the old empire. They work to restore the emperor’s rule, often aligning with House Denaroth.
    
2. **The Free Cities Coalition**: A collection of merchant republics and city-states that declared independence after the empire's collapse. They focus on trade and the pursuit of wealth, often at odds with the more traditionalist noble houses.
    
3. **The Silver Hand**: A secretive faction of knights and warriors who work behind the scenes to restore Anuire’s unity by force, though their methods are often seen as extreme.
    
4. **The Gorgon’s Emissaries**: Though many believe the Gorgon is a myth, there are those who seek to serve the ancient enemy in exchange for power. This faction is composed of those who worship or follow the Gorgon’s supposed will.
