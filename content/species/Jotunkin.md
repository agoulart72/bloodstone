### Jotunkin Characteristics

The **Jotunkin** are giant-descended beings with three distinct subspecies, each shaped by their unique cultures:

1. **Firbolg**: Peaceful and deeply connected to nature, they are often guardians of forests and sacred places. Firbolg are highly respected by elves for their wisdom and tranquility.
    
2. **Goliath**: Nomadic and focused on personal achievement, Goliaths value strength and endurance, thriving in harsh environments. They tend to fit well with human communities.
    
3. **Trollblood**: Brutal yet intelligent, they excel in mechanical engineering and crafting. Their talents align closely with dwarven societies, fostering a strong bond.
    

All Jotunkin share a mutual respect but struggle to understand each other's vastly different cultural values. They also have a shared history of conflict with the **Dragonborn**.
