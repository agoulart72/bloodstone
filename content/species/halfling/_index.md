Halflings were once the native inhabitants of a plane similar to the Feywild, but this plane was corrupted by the dark god and became the Shadow Plane. In the past, halflings crossed into the Material Plane in large numbers, though some remain behind, affected by the corruption. Strong individuals can teleport between planes, but most rely on ancient portals.

Halflings are adaptable, learning to live within the societies of other races, often maintaining some links to their original culture but blending with the customs of their new homes. They are skilled at stealth and can Mist Step a few times a day, making them excellent spies or infiltrators.

However, some races, like the **Therion**, **Jotunkin**, and **Dragonborn**, view them with suspicion, while others tend to overlook them, often treating them as lesser members of society. Halflings' ability to navigate this complex social landscape allows them to thrive, albeit from the shadows.
