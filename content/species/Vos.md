The Vos are a proud and deeply conflicted people, defined by their history and their unyielding connection to the dark god. Once fierce warriors serving their dark god in his conquest, they are now haunted by the remnants of that allegiance. After the defeat of their deity, the Vos were left to pick up the pieces of their fractured society.

Nomadic by nature, the Vos wander the wilderness, rarely settling in one place for long. Their society is built on strength and survival, with every member constantly proving their worth through combat and valor. Like the Dothraki, the Vos are masters of mounted warfare, and their warriors ride powerful, agile steeds with unmatched skill, using the horse as both a symbol of their power and a key to their way of life. Their warriors value personal honor above all else, with the strongest vying for leadership in brutal duels.

The Vos are divided into clans, each following its own path but bound together by shared heritage and the influence of their ancestors. Though divided, they share a common belief in the importance of ancestral spirits and the power of their bloodlines. The Vos’ culture places a heavy emphasis on the past, with each clan fiercely guarding the legacy of their ancestors. However, their history is also a source of conflict—many clans struggle with the betrayal of their former loyalty to the dark god, and the guilt of that past often clouds their judgment.

Despite their turbulent past, the Vos have adapted, driven by an unrelenting will to survive. Their ancestors fought in the service of the dark god, and now they continue to roam the vast, untamed landscapes, seeking opportunities for conquest, wealth, and survival. However, the shadow of their past looms large, and the ghosts of the dark god’s influence continue to guide and haunt their decisions.

At the heart of the Vos’ nomadic lifestyle lies their ongoing migration. With no permanent home, they are constantly searching for fertile lands, valuable resources, and battlefields to prove their might. The Vos’ culture remains deeply tied to the wilderness, where they believe the spirits of their ancestors guide their actions.

Yet, with the passing of each generation, the Vos grow more fractured. Some still cling to the old ways, while others seek to abandon the legacy of the dark god and forge a new path. The constant movement, the warrior spirit, and the struggle between the past and the future define the Vos people—an ever-evolving culture, shaped by the weight of history but driven by the promise of survival.

### Government

The government of the Vos is deeply tribal, with power being held by clan leaders and the strongest warriors. Each clan is autonomous, ruled by a chieftain or warlord who gains their position through strength and combat prowess. These leaders are typically chosen by the strongest warriors, and their authority is challenged if they lose a duel or fail in combat. The Vos maintain a loose confederation of clans, where alliances are made based on shared ancestry or mutual interest. Their government is highly decentralized, with decisions often made by councils of elders and warriors, though the voice of the strongest chieftains typically holds the most weight.

Social structure is based on clans, each with its own traditions, beliefs, and hierarchy. Leadership within these clans is determined by combat prowess and ancestral claims. Nomadic and warlike, the Vos maintain close ties to their ancestors, who guide their actions through rituals and spiritual practices. The notion of fate and destiny is central to their culture, with many believing that the blood of their forebears runs through them, giving them the strength to continue their ancestral wars.

### Religion and Beliefs

They revere their ancestors, honoring them through rituals and ceremonies meant to maintain the strength and honor of their bloodlines. Many of their beliefs are rooted in the idea of fate and honor, and they seek to live up to the legacy of their forebears. The Vos also have a strong connection to warrior gods, whose guidance is sought before battle. Ancestors are believed to shape the destiny of individuals, guiding them toward victory or doom.
