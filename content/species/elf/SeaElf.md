### History and Origins
Sea Elves are an ancient, enigmatic race that once lived in the depths of the oceans, creating elaborate underwater cities. Their origins are intertwined with a great and ancient sea deity, and their civilization flourished for millennia. As the world above changed, Sea Elves adapted, maintaining their connection to the deep seas and now live on coastal regions, blending into human societies. Though they outwardly present as friendly, their true beliefs and ties to powerful, ancient entities remain hidden from other races, adding layers of mystery and secrecy to their culture.

### Government and Social Structure
The Sea Elves organize their society around a system of city-states built within coral reefs and deep-sea trenches, each ruled by a council of elders known as the Tidecallers. These councils oversee trade, diplomacy, and religious practices, but ultimate authority lies with the Oracles—individuals who commune with the ancient entities they secretly revere. While each city-state governs itself, they maintain strong trade and cultural ties with coastal settlements. Their social hierarchy is fluid, with influence determined by wisdom, magical prowess, and naval skill rather than hereditary rule.

### Religion and Beliefs
Sea Elves have a complex and secretive religious belief system. They revere the Great Old Ones, ancient and mysterious entities from the depths of the oceans. While they outwardly appear friendly and approachable, they keep their reverence hidden, considering it taboo to speak of it openly to other races. Their devotion to these ancient forces influences many aspects of their culture, including their seafaring ways and hidden rituals. They see themselves as agents of the Great Old Ones, subtly advancing their goals while maintaining an appearance of neutrality.

### Society and Culture
Sea Elves live in tight-knit coastal communities, with leadership roles distributed among their most respected members. Their culture centers around a deep connection to the ocean, its creatures, and its currents. They excel in underwater survival, commerce, and navigation, often acting as intermediaries between coastal civilizations and the sea. Their traditions combine practical seafaring skills with rich, secretive rituals tied to their reverence for ancient alien entities. Their beliefs and customs are secretive, with a focus on maintaining harmony with the sea’s unpredictable power.

### Economy and Technology
The Sea Elves have a sophisticated economy centered around their mastery of the seas. They are expert fishermen, harvesting rare and valuable sea creatures. Their knowledge of navigation and shipbuilding is unparalleled, allowing them to create advanced ships for exploration and trade. Their culture places significant importance on the sustainability of their maritime resources, ensuring the oceans are never overexploited. They also engage in trade with coastal societies, offering unique goods such as rare pearls, coral, and enchanted underwater relics in exchange for materials they cannot easily access.
