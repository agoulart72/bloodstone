### History and Origins
Moon Elves are a more mystical and secretive subrace of elves, deeply attuned to the cycles of the moon and the powers of illusion. They trace their origins to an ancient empire that thrived on magic, especially illusionary arts. Their culture values subtlety, wisdom, and harmony with nature, particularly the night. As their empire declined, they retreated into hidden enclaves, preserving their magical knowledge. Today, Moon Elves are often seen as elusive and enigmatic, their magic still revered but largely forgotten by other races.

### Government and Social Structure
The Moon Elves have a decentralized government led by a secretive masked council. Each council member wears an enchanted mask that conceals their identity, ensuring decisions are made without personal bias or outside influence. Only the High Sorcerer Matriarch knows the true identities of all council members, serving as the sole link between them. This system reinforces their values of mystery, autonomy, and hidden wisdom. Decisions are made through careful deliberation, often guided by visions, omens, and their deep understanding of fate and the unseen forces of the world.

### Religion and Beliefs
The Moon Elves have a deeply mystical and enigmatic belief system centered around illusion, dreams, and the hidden truths of the universe. They do not revere gods in a traditional sense but instead honor celestial forces, the cycles of the moon, and the interplay between light and shadow. They believe reality is a veil, and through meditation, magic, and introspection, one can glimpse the deeper truths beneath the illusion. Their spiritual practices often involve ritualistic dances, divination, and trance-like journeys guided by lunar phases.

### Society and Culture
Moon Elves are renowned for their stealth and cunning, and their most skilled members are often found among the deadliest assassins. Their culture prizes secrecy, subterfuge, and individual freedom, traits that make them exceptional at operating in the shadows. Trained in the arts of illusion, deception, and silent killing, Moon Elves are masters of infiltration. The decentralized nature of their society allows them to operate covertly, with little oversight or authority, making them particularly adept at gathering intelligence and eliminating targets without leaving a trace.

### Economy and Technology
The Moon Elves' economy is primarily focused on arcane magic, espionage, and high-quality craftsmanship, including enchanted items and stealth tools. They possess knowledge of intricate spellcraft, and their technology revolves around magical innovations, particularly in invisibility and illusions. Their trade is often covert, dealing in rare magical components or espionage-related services, and they are selective about allies. Their societal wealth is often held in the form of magical artifacts or treasures obtained through subtle means rather than traditional trade.
