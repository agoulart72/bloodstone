The elves are the oldest race in the world, their civilization once thriving in great empires that spanned vast lands. Capable of living for millennia, some individuals remember the ancient eras before other species arose. However, their once-great empire has crumbled, and their birth rate has dwindled.

### History and Origins
 The elves are the most ancient race in the world, with their history spanning millennia. They were once the dominant power in the world, with a vast empire that embraced a deep connection to nature, magic, and knowledge. However, their empire has since crumbled, and they now face a slow decline. Their birth rates are extremely low, and many ancient elves still remember the era before the other races emerged. Despite their fall from greatness, they still hold onto their culture, although it is increasingly isolated and fading.    

**Subraces**:

- **Sun Elves**: Tied to fire and the sun, these elves are militaristic, focused on honor and strength.
    
- **Moon Elves**: Masters of illusion, these elves are subtle, valuing secrecy and diplomacy.
    
- **Wood Elves**: Closely linked to nature, these elves dwell in the forests and act as guardians of the natural world.
    
- **Sea Elves**: Benevolent and adaptable, they breathe underwater and mix well with coastal human communities. However, beneath their friendly demeanor, they revere ancient entities, their secret goals shrouded in mystery.
    
- **Ice Elves**: Cursed with an ancient affliction, the Ice Elves are now a society in decay. Their curse turns them into cold, deathless beings over time, and they fear their eventual transformation. Though most of their race has succumbed to this curse, a few hidden individuals still remain, ashamed of their heritage and desperate to live in secret.
    

The elvesâ€™ decline, combined with their deep connections to nature and powerful magical legacies, makes them both revered and sorrowful. Yet even in their diminished state, they remain a force to be reckoned with, tied to ancient knowledge and lost traditions.
