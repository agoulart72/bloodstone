### History and Origins
Wood Elves originated as the guardians of the deep forests, living in harmony with nature. They were once part of a grand elven empire, but as the empire crumbled, they retreated into the wilderness, abandoning the cities and courts of their kin. Their society is centered around protecting the natural world, and they have a deep bond with the forests they call home. Wood Elves are skilled hunters, trackers, and archers, and they live in secluded, self-sufficient communities, often shying away from the affairs of other races.

### Government and Social Structure
The Wood Elves govern themselves through a loose confederation of clans, each led by a chieftain or elder council. These leaders uphold traditions and act as mediators rather than rulers, ensuring balance between their people and nature. Decisions affecting multiple clans are made through gatherings known as Moots, where representatives meet beneath ancient trees to debate and reach consensus. Society is structured around kinship and survival, with hunters, druids, and warriors holding important roles. Their culture values self-sufficiency, communal living, and a deep spiritual connection to the forests they protect.

### Religion and Beliefs
The Wood Elves revere nature itself as sacred, believing that the forests and wildlands are alive with spirits and ancient wisdom. They do not worship gods but instead practice animism, honoring the trees, rivers, and animals as manifestations of the worldâ€™s soul. Their druids and shamans act as spiritual leaders, interpreting the will of nature and maintaining balance. Seasonal festivals, rites of passage, and sacred hunts play a significant role in their traditions, ensuring harmony between the elves and their ever-changing environment.

### Society and Culture
Wood Elves are deeply connected to the forests they inhabit. Their society revolves around nature, and they maintain a harmonious relationship with the wilderness. They are a close-knit, tribal culture, led by elder druids who act as both spiritual and political leaders. Wood Elves place great emphasis on self-sufficiency, survival skills, and protecting the natural world from harm. Their culture is one of balance, and they are known for their intricate knowledge of herbalism, tracking, and archery. They also value freedom and independence, often living in secluded communities deep in the forest.

### Economy and Technology
The Wood Elves' economy is closely tied to the natural world, with their primary resources coming from the forests and wildlife around them. They engage in sustainable hunting, gathering, and foraging, with a deep respect for nature's balance. They are skilled in crafting with wood, stone, and plant-based materials, creating intricate tools, weapons, and architecture. They also practice herbalism and alchemy, making potent medicines and potions. Trade with other races is generally focused on their high-quality handcrafted goods, though they rarely seek profit, preferring to live in harmony with nature.
