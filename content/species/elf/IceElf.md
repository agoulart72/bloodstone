### History and Origins
The Ice Elves were once a proud and powerful race, but a mysterious curse has transformed most of them into cold, soulless beings. Only a few Ice Elves remain untouched by the curse, and these rare individuals leave their homeland to live in secrecy among other races, fearing the reputation of their race and the spread of the curse. They are driven by the hope of avoiding the inevitable transformation that defines their kind.

### Government and Social Structure
The Ice Elves have no centralized government, as their cursed condition has shattered their once-proud society. Most of them live in fragmented, nomadic bands that roam the frozen wastes, ruled by the strongest or most cunning among them. Some still attempt to maintain the old ways, forming small enclaves with a council of elders, but distrust and fear run deep. The few untainted Ice Elves who escape their homeland often live in secrecy among other races, hiding their true heritage to avoid persecution and the stigma of their cursed kin.

### Religion and Beliefs
The Ice Elves' religious beliefs are shaped by the curse that afflicts them. They venerate forgotten spirits and entities tied to the cold, often seeking solace or strength from these powers. However, many of their religious practices are rooted in a form of despair, as they believe their fate is sealed due to the curse. They view the ancient spirits as both a source of power and a reminder of their lost heritage. Their faith is often hidden, shared only in hushed whispers or through secret rituals to stave off the overwhelming sorrow of their cursed existence.

### Society and Culture
The Ice Elves no longer live in their own cities, having abandoned them due to the corruption that once cursed their people. Now, they are scattered across the world, often living in cities built by other species. While they remain isolated from others, they rely on secrecy, enduring hardship and hiding their true heritage. Only a few brave individuals attempt to blend into societies where they can live without revealing their cursed past, although they are always haunted by the shame of their lineage.

### Economy and Technology
The Ice Elves were once masters of high arcane magic, particularly in the schools of Abjuration and Necromancy. Their advanced understanding of these arts allowed them to develop powerful wards and enchantments. Before the curse, they crafted delicate magical items and components of immense value. Now, only a few individuals not affected by the curse continue to study arcane knowledge, working as scholars or crafting magical objects in secret. Their once-thriving magical society now exists in the shadows, with its rich arcane history all but forgotten.
