### Dwarves

The dwarves are an ancient and proud race of craftsmen and engineers, known for their skill in metallurgy and stonework. Unlike traditional dwarves, they do not live underground, but instead roam the countryside in massive landships—gigantic wheeled vehicles that serve as both homes and mobile workshops. These landships are powered by ancient engines, once shared by all clans but now modified by each clan to fit their unique needs and preferences.

**Clans**:

- **Ironclaw Clan**: Known for their engineering prowess, the Ironclaws prioritize innovation and the development of powerful war machines.
    
- **Stonehammer Clan**: Traditionalists, the Stonehammers focus on preserving ancient dwarven techniques of stone and metalwork, maintaining a connection to their ancestors’ craftsmanship.
    
- **Thunderforge Clan**: Masters of the forge and creators of powerful elemental-infused weapons, they harness the power of storms to fuel their creations.
    
- **Grimsteel Clan**: Focused on magical resistance, this clan’s members are experts in crafting enchanted armor and tools that repel magical influences.
    

With a deep connection to their ancient technology and a resistance to magic, dwarves are both respected and feared. Their society is built around honor, craftsmanship, and survival, but as time goes on, their once-unified race is starting to develop differing ideals and goals, with each clan embracing a distinct vision of the future.
