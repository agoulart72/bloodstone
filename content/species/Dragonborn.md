### Dragonborn Characteristics

**Culture and Rituals**: Dragonborn society is rooted in shamanistic practices, where they connect with their draconic ancestors through rituals. These ceremonies involve elemental offerings, trance-like states, and sacred dances.

**Elemental Connection**: Each Dragonborn clan is bonded to a specific elemental force (fire, ice, lightning, etc.), which influences their skills, beliefs, and way of life.

**Ritualistic Blood Sports**: Dragonborn engage in brutal sports like **Flameclaw**, a fire-themed game where teams battle using elemental breath and strength to control a magical sphere. These games are deeply tied to their spirituality, with losers sometimes facing ritual sacrifices.

**Honor and Tradition**: Honor is central to their society, with a focus on spiritual growth and serving their draconic ancestors, rather than just physical power or battle.
