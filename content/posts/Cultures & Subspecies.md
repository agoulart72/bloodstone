Halfling
Shadowstep
Teleportation: As a bonus action, you can teleport to a location you can see within 30 feet that is in dim light or darkness.

Limitations: You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses after finishing a long rest.

Duration: You remain in the Shadowfell for only a moment before returning to the material plane, meaning creatures cannot interact with you while you are there.


- Anuire - Lightfoot (standard)
    Shadowed Escape
    When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to activate Shadowstep and teleport up to 30 feet. After you teleport, the attack is nullified (as if you evaded it entirely). You must take a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

    Veil of the Shadowfell
    Once per long rest, as an action, you can cloak yourself in the shadows of the Shadowfell, gaining invisibility for 1 minute. This invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.
- Brechtur - Rillkin - River Halflings
    Rillkin are halflings of winding rivers, fertile floodplains, and hidden freshwater inlets. They are skilled fishers, boat-crafters, and herbalists, living in stilt-houses or floating barges that drift with the seasons. Where other halflings hide in the hills, Rillkin disappear into reeds and fog.
    Lifestyles: Semi-nomadic; follow rivers with the seasons, traveling in family barges or dwelling in riverside villages.
    Homes: Live in woven-reed houseboats or stilthouses connected by rope bridges and floating gardens.
    River Lore: You gain proficiency in Nature or Medicine (your choice). If you already have one of these, you may double your proficiency bonus on it instead.
    Poison Hardened: You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.    
- Khinasi - Sirokai - Nomadic Desert Halflings
    Sandkin travel in extended families or caravans across scorching deserts. They are hardy, clever, and deeply spiritual, reading omens in wind patterns and the shifting sands.

    Sun-blessed vision - Advantage on saving throws against illusions.
